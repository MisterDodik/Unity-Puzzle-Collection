# **Secret Door**

**Type**: Block Pushing Puzzle

**Goal**: Use all blocks from buttons to fill the grid


### ðŸŽ® Gameplay Description

- The puzzle consists of a grid of **rectangles** with **buttons** at certain positions.

- Each button displays the number of **remaining** blocks it can **generate**.

- Objective: Press buttons to spawn blocks and **move** them along the grid (up, down, left, or right) depending on the button's position.

- Blocks **push** other blocks if there is an obstacle in their path.

- **Misplacing** blocks can leave some buttons unable to spawn further blocks.



### ðŸ›  Implementation Notes

- Blocks track their current **position** and movement **direction**.

- Buttons track their remaining **block count**.

- Movement is handled via coroutines, resolving collisions and pushes dynamically.

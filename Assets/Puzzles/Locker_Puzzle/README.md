### ðŸŽ® Gameplay Description

- The puzzle consists of a **grid of triangles**, each with a **path** drawn on it.

- A ball must travel from the **starting triangle** to the **target triangle**.

- **Movement rules**:

  - The ball moves to a **neighboring** triangle when it is **clicked**, but only if the triangle is **interactable**.

  - A triangle is **interactable** if its path **connects directly** to the current triangle where the ball is located.

- Rotational challenge:

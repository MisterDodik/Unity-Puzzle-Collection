🧩 Unity Puzzle Collection

This repository contains a collection of 20 puzzles and mini-games that I developed during my time at Vincell Studios, refactored for demonstration purposes.
All puzzles were originally created for escape-room style adventure games, and each one has been cleaned of studio-specific code, namespaces, and frameworks.


🔧 Tech Stack

Engine: Unity

Language: C#

Target platform: Mobile (Android & iOS)

Timeframe: 2025 (professional work at Vincell Studios)

```

Each puzzle follows the same folder structure (Art, Prefabs, Scripts, Database) and contains:

- A minimal Unity scene and necessary assets for that puzzle

- A short README.md with explanation & optional GIF demo


🧰 Notes

All puzzles are independent and can be opened and tested individually.

No external or licensed materials are included.

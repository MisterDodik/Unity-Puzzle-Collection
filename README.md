🧩 Unity Puzzle Collection

This repository contains a collection of 21 puzzles and mini-games that I developed during my time at Vincell Studios, refactored and made standalone for demonstration purposes.
All puzzles were originally created for escape-room style adventure games, and each one has been cleaned of studio-specific code, namespaces, and frameworks.

🔧 Tech Stack

Engine: Unity

Language: C#

Target platform: Mobile (Android & iOS)

Timeframe: 2025 (internship & professional work at Vincell Studios)

🎯 Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repo is to:

Showcase my work on various interactive puzzles and mini-games built in Unity.

Demonstrate problem-solving, clean code practices, and gameplay system design.

Serve as a portfolio reference for potential employers and collaborators.

Each puzzle can run independently, and all external dependencies (frameworks, studio-specific systems) have been removed or replaced with self-contained logic.

A minimal Unity scene and necessary assets for that puzzle

A short README.md with explanation & optional GIF demo


🧰 Notes

Studio code has been fully removed.

All puzzles are independent and can be opened and tested individually.

No external assets or licensed materials are included.
